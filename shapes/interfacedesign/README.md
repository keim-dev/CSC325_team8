How to run:
Abstract Class Version:
1. Open terminal in the src folder.
2. Compile files: javac shapes/abstractdesign/*.java
3. Run program: java shapes.abstractdesign.Main

Interface Version:
1. Open terminal in the src folder.
2. Compile files: javac shapes/interfacedesign/*.java
3. Run program: java shapes.interfacedesign.Main

Why this matters:
- Abstract classes let you share code between shapes. Good when shapes are similar.  
- Interfaces let shapes have different abilities without forcing a hierarchy. Good for flexibility.  

Comparing them helps you decide which design is easier to use, read, and change in real programs.
