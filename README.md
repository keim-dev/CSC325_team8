Elijah Keim Assignment 8
Overview: Readability and efficiency increased with the number of Lambdas added. The calrity of exact processes was reduced, however this was due to the code being more concise leaving less context to potentially gain in order to understand it. Getting the lambdas to work as the return statement proved challenging in some cases and I avoided it when possible because I was less comfortable using them in that way. 
AI Overview: I used AI for single line suggestions throughout my coding process. In addition, I asked AI several times to ensure my lambdas were working properly and implemented some of the changes that were suggested to fix potential errors and was also used when implementing the comparisons in the lambda expressions. Although AI generated code was revised, in most cases it was simply changing variable or object names to fit personal naming conventions. 

Poortions of upper levels were completed but only level 1 was completed entirely.
