# Assignment 5
AI reflection:
  I used AI to set up the blank scene and launch requirements (with an explanation) before I began writing code. 
  Afterwards AI was used as a reference for how some objects or classes work/interact or to complete lines of code
  with the built in suggestions. At this point I had built the entire project in a single file and then asked Copilot 
  how it would seperate the code into different classes and files. Using the AI response I manually organized my 
  written code into classes. 

  Up to level 1 was completed
