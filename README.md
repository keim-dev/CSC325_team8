Level 1:
  I did not use any prompts while using AI to help me code. I began each line by typing it myself and wrote the entirety of most lines manually, however I would occasionally use the AI generated suggestions for completing the line of code. 
Level 2:
  In the process of writing level 1 I accidentally satisfied the requirements of level 2. Using the same amount of AI as in level 1 I had created a second interface (Swimmable) with a method and put two methods in my first interface (AnimalRunnable). By calling both interfaces and all their methods in main I believe I satisfied level 2.
Level 3:
  It was only after preparing for level 3 that I actually commited my local changes to the repositories origin. Afterwards, I realized that the repository I cloned to my Desktop github was not the same as my web repo so all of my commits were put into the main branch. I then spent over an hour trying to reverse these commits and recreate the branch all the commits were supposed to go into. After doing this I asked copilot how to package the .java files correctly. In the process of packaging and repackaging all of my files the proper way, VScode was showing that all of my implementation and inheritance relationships were completely broken. I tried fixing it manually at first to no avail with several errors being displayed by VScode after all of the syntax was rewritten properly. I then asked copilot to fix all error messages in the files I was working on and none of code structure or syntax was changed after implementing all of the changes suggested by copilot. While trying to fix everything that broke in packaging and committing to github the submission deadline passed so no other aspects of level 3 have been implemented at this time.
